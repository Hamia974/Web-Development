            Born in Lahore, Khan graduated from Keble College, Oxford. He began his international cricket career in a 
            1971 Test series against England. Khan learned reverse swing bowling from Sarfraz Nawaz and passed on 
            this technique to Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis, who developed and popularised it in subsequent years.
             He was named one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1983. Khan is also credited with advancing the 
             idea of neutral umpiring in cricket during his captaincy.Khan led Pakistan to its
              first-ever Test series victories in India and England during 1987.

            In addition to
            achieving the All-Rounder's Triple, Khan holds the world record for the most wickets, along with the
             second-best bowling figures in an innings as a captain in Test cricket. Moreover, he has won the most
              Player of the Series awards in Test cricket for Pakistan and ranks fourth 
              overall in Test history.
               Khan has often been compared to Franz Beckenbauer in terms of his popularity and influence in Pakistan.

            He was awarded the International Cricketer of the Year award in 1989. Playing until 1992, he captained the
    Pakistan national cricket team for most of the 1980s and early 1990s. He initially decided to retire after
     the 1987 Cricket World Cup. However, at the request of President Zia-ul-Haq, he returned to lead the team 
     in 1988 and ultimately guided Pakistan to its first Cricket World Cup victory in 1992.  In 2009, he was inducted into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.
